This package is released under the LaTeX Project Public License version
1.3c. A copy of the license can be found in `LICENSE`. 

This package began by reverse-engineering tikz-timing, a package by Martin
Sharrer for drawing timing diagrams of clocked electrical circuits with
TikZ. Under the terms of the LaTeX Project Public License version 1.3c,
the licence under which tikz-timing is released, tikz-dna is considered
a Derived Work not intended as a replacement of the original Work (tikz-timing).
You can obtain tikz-timing on CTAN at <https://ctan.org/pkg/tikz-timing>.
Thanks to Martin Scharrer for tikz-timing and his numerous contributions
to the LaTeX community.

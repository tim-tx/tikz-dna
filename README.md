This package is under development and provided under the LaTeX Project

Part of this package (the contents of the `shorthand/` folder) was built
by reverse-engineering tikz-timing, a package by Martin Sharrer for drawing
timing diagrams of clocked electrical circuits with Ti*k*Z. Under the terms
of the LaTeX Project Public License version 1.3c, the licence under which
tikz-timing is released, tikz-dna is considered a Derived Work that is
not intended as a replacement of the original Work (tikz-timing). You can
obtain tikz-timing on CTAN at <https://ctan.org/pkg/tikz-timing>. Thanks
to Martin Scharrer for tikz-timing and his numerous contributions to the
LaTeX community.

Parts of the `shapes.dna` library are modified versions (not replacements)
of shapes provided in Ti*k*Z by Till Tantau. These are also Derived Works.
Ti*k*Z is available at <https://www.ctan.org/pkg/pgf>.
